## Introduction
Multi-level Cross-view Contrastive Learning for Knowledge-aware Recommender System (MCCLK) is a knowledge-aware recommendation solution based on GNN and Contrastive Learning,
proposing a multi-level cross-view contrastive framework to enhance representation learning from multi-faced aspects.

## Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.7.9. The required packages are as follows:
- pytorch == 1.5.0
- numpy == 1.15.4
- scipy == 1.1.0
- sklearn == 0.20.0
- torch_scatter == 2.0.5
- torch_sparse == 0.6.10
- networkx == 2.5

## Usage
The hyper-parameter search range and optimal settings have been clearly stated in the codes (see the parser function in utils/parser.py).
* Train and Test

```
python main.py 
```

## Dataset

We provide three processed datasets: Book-Crossing, MovieLens-1M, and Last.FM.

We follow the paper " [Ripplenet: Propagating user preferences on the knowledge
graph for recommender systems](https://github.com/hwwang55/RippleNet)." to process data.
